	<p>Garcia Hotspur is a demon hunter extraordinaire. After his girlfriend Paula is kidnapped by the lord of the underworld, he'll stop at nothing to get her back—busting his way into Hell and obliterating anything that dares to stand in his way. And while he's deadly serious about saving Paula, he's not afraid to throw in a few puerile quips while he does so.</p>
		<details>
  <summary>Story</summary>
  <p>Hotspur's background is largely unclear. He has made an occupation out of hunting demons. During his career, Hotspur won a demon named Johnson in a bet. The two became friends, and Johnson uses his shapeshifting abilities to help Hotspur in the field. He found Paula in a dumpster one day, the two have been living together ever since.<div></div>
  After a dying demon makes reference to Paula, Hotspur returns home to find his girlfriend hanging from a ceiling fan. Demons burst from her corpse and attack Hotspur, however he overpowers them until their leader, Fleming, arrives. Fleming offers Hotspur a deal to atone for decimating his demon army, in return for Paula's life. Hotspur refuses and chases Fleming into the City of the Damned.</p>

	<p>Every protagonist has to have a right-hand man… or skull. Johnson's not only a loyal companion to Garcia, but also a useful tool, turning into a torch, a variety of guns, and even a sweet ride. A former demon that has renounced the vile ways of the underworld, Johnson also provides vital information on the realm of the damned, recording it all in the aptly named Johnsonpedia. Don't let his British charm fool you though—he's got a bit of a naughty side as well.</p>
	<details>
  <summary>Story</summary>
  <p>Johnson was once a normal demon within the City of the Damned until he was cursed and banished. At some point he met Garcia and they developed a strong friendship. He has a taste for strawberries, and a very colored history among the red light district of the City of the Damned, once a frequent visitor to the Angel Kiss hostess club. His favorite story from the City library is of the Unbreakable Huntress, the first female demon huntress to face Fleming Whatshisfaces. <div></div>

  After the suicide of Hotspur's girlfriend, Paula, Johnson accompanies Garcia on his journey through the City of the Damned. He serves as Garcia's guide to the Underworld, explaining the bizarre world to Garcia as best he can all the while protecting his friend by forming himself into several firearms for Garcia's use.</p>

	<p>Every story's got to have a villain, and Fleming is the worst of the worst. The literal King of Hell, Fleming derives pleasure from the torment of others. His kidnapping and subsequent torture of Paula is not only painful to her, but to Garcia who is forced to witness her demise again and again. Getting to kill this asshole is just an added perk of the mission to rescue Paula.</p>
	<details>
  <summary>Story</summary>
  <p>Similarly to Garcia Hotspur, much of Fleming's past is largely unclear.  When Garcia and Johnson arrive at the library in Act 4-3, Johnson tells Garcia the story of The Unbreakable Huntress. <div>Through the story, the player learns that sometime before the events of the game, Fleming was once challenged by a demon huntress dressed in red (Paula).  Despite the huntress' effort, Fleming quickly overpowers her by severing her arms and legs.  Even when she knew the Lord of Demons had the upper hand, the huntresses will wasn't shaken, and she told Fleming that while he may take her life, he would never have her for his own.  Impressed by the huntresses refusal to accept death, he reattached her limbs and proceeded to make her his mistress.  Throughout the years, Fleming had killed the huntress hundreds of times, always pleasured by her proud refusal to die.  Even though the Lord of Demons constantly tortured her, the huntress would always try to return to the mortal world.</p>

	<p>As beautiful as she is mysterious, Paula meets an unfortunate fate when she is kidnapped by Fleming and dragged into the underworld. Without wasting a second, Garcia plunges in after her, willing to risk it all to save his beloved girlfriend. However, as Garcia dives deeper into the depths of hell, he realizes there may be a bit more to her than meets the eye...</p>
	<details>
  <summary>Story</summary>
  <p>Paula, originally found by her boyfriend Garcia Hotspur behind a supermarket, has a mysterious past that hints she was once the Unbreakable Huntress, a demon hunter from the City of the Damned. Though initially silent, Paula's first words to Hotspur were a frantic warning not to answer a phone call, which seems linked to her past with the demon lord Fleming. <div></div>
  Later, after being rescued from the City of the Damned, Paula falls into a trance, revealing her deeper connection to Fleming. It's implied that she was once his queen, constantly killed and resurrected, echoing her repeated deaths as Hotspur tries to save her.</p>

	<p>Trivia:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Paula appears to be heavily based on Sid Vicious' deceased girlfriend Nancy Spungen in terms of appearance and temperament. Nancy was known for her violent temper tantrums and self-destructive behavior, a trait Paula shares with Nancy Spungen.</li>
			<li>The six wings of Paula's demonic form are a reference to the Seraphim, a race of angels who were said to appear as six-winged humans and were considered to be the angels closest to Yahweh. Coincidentally, Lucifer and several other demons were said to be Seraphim prior to their falls from grace.</li>
